Risk Assessment with AI and OpenFAIR

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of **AI-based risk prediction** with the **OpenFAIR framework** to provide a comprehensive risk assessment solution. The goal is to predict risk levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) using machine learning and then use the OpenFAIR framework to quantify and analyze the predicted risks.

## Key Features
- **AI Model**: A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) is trained to predict risk levels based on features like Threat Event Frequency (TEF), Vulnerability, and Asset Value.
- **OpenFAIR Integration**: The AI model's predictions are exported to a CSV file and imported into an OpenFAIR tool (e.g., RiskLens or FAIR-U) for further analysis.
- **Risk Quantification**: The OpenFAIR tool calculates **Loss Event Frequency (LEF)** and **Loss Magnitude (LM)** to quantify the risk.
- **Risk Visualization**: The tool generates risk heatmaps and scenarios to help stakeholders understand the risk landscape.
- **Actionable Insights**: The tool recommends mitigation strategies to reduce the risk.

## Workflow
The workflow for this project is as follows:

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - The dataset includes features like **TEF**, **Vulnerability**, and **Asset Value**, and a target variable **Risk Level**.
   - The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) is trained on the dataset.
   - The model is fine-tuned using **hyperparameter tuning** and **cross-validation** to improve accuracy.

3. **Risk Prediction**:
   - The trained model is used to predict risk levels for new data inputs.
   - The predictions are exported to a **CSV file** for integration with OpenFAIR tools.

4. **OpenFAIR Analysis**:
   - The predictions are imported into an OpenFAIR tool (e.g., RiskLens or FAIR-U).
   - The tool calculates **LEF** and **LM** and generates risk heatmaps and scenarios.

5. **Risk Report Generation**:
   - A comprehensive risk report is generated, combining AI predictions and OpenFAIR analysis.
